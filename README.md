# Handwritten-Recognition

A project created to recognize handwritten digits.  Provides a user interface for drawing a letter and the program will use a neural network using various learning methods to determine the letter drawn.  The artificial neural network can learn from training data using supervised or unsupervised learning methods.  Additionally, includes functionality for displaying weights graphically and outputting runtime data from the neural networks to data files.

Created for the Integrated Science 3-4 class for the science fair.
